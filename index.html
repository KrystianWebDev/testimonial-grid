              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
              current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
              i got every penny's worth.

              "I was EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. i've been
              looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
              amazing experience here. I signed up for free intro course and
              found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
              12 weeks was the best - and most gruealing - time of my life.
              Since completing the course i've successfully switched career,
              working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

              Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
              Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was

        <p class="content">
          "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs wo can only say wonderfull things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hand-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
          full-stack-developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
